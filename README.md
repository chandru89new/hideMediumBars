## What's this?

- It's a Chrome Extension (unpacked).
- The extension (once installed) will remove those top and bottom sticky bars from Medium (and Medium-based websites).

## But why?

Because I use a small laptop (1368x768px) and those sticky bars reduce the reading viewport to a ridiculously small space. 

## How to use?

1. Clone / download and unzip the files.
2. In Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click on `Load unpacked extension`
4. Select the folder and "Open"
5. Open any Medium/Medium-based page to test. (Refresh any currently-open page for the plugin to work on that page).

## Why is it not on Chrome Web Store?

Pull requests are welcome. (This is my first Chrome extension so mighty helpful if you could make this code better. Thanks to anyone who takes the time and effort to do that.)
